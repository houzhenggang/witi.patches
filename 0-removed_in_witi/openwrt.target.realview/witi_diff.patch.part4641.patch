-This ARM Ltd. Realview target is intended to be used with the Qemu emulator.
-It can be used to prototype an OpenWrt firmware targetting ARM-based hardware.
-One could also use it to troubleshoot ARM applications without access to real
-hardware.
-
-To use the images built by OpenWrt with qemu, use the following commands:
-
-qemu-system-arm -M realview-eb-mpcore \
--kernel bin/realview/openwrt-realview-vmlinux.elf \
--nographic -m 128
-
-and enjoy the system booting.
